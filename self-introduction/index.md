Hi! My name is Anastasia Kozlova, and I’m a junior frontend developer!
Now I’m attending the Frontend course in RSS and getting more and more charmed of this profession with every task!

I graduated from Moscow Architectural Institute in 2016 and since then I worked in architecture scale models workshop. Where I mastered the way from regular specialist position to team lead and project manager.

What kind of job was it? Quite stressful, though exciting. The range of skills needed was the widest - graphic-design, 3d-modelling, operating CNC and laser machines, 3d printing  et cetera... And of course I developed soft-skills necessary for work with the team and all sorts of clients. Thanks to this job, I got used to read manuals, study new technologies and implement them for the working process  - I found out, that is my real passion! 

Actually I’m on a maternity leave now, so time-management is the skill already implemented. 

I started learning Javascript from scratch trying to write scripts for Adobe Illustrator. And since then I loved that. 

Step by step, tasks become more complex. My latest project is Minesweeper task in RSS.  Though I see endless room for its improvement, I am quite satisfied with the result. I used instruments that are already covered up with the program of the course, such as ES6 and webpack, and I’m looking forward to refactor it later with more effective and ergonomic tools. 

As for pet-projects, I sometimes take part in development of AR experiences with contemporary artists. Also I am planning building a platform to connect charity funds and volunteers, ready to give various online lessons to people in need.

Looking into the future, I plan to become a real good developer in a year or so, and I’m ready for such a change of career. I would like to work in projects somehow connected with 
3D, CG, WebGL or AR , but anyway I’m wide open for any new exciting experience… so, let’s keep in touch! 

Thanks for your time, and 
have a nice day! Bye!
